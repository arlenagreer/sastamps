Hi Nancy,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the improvements that have been made to the SAPA website.

Here's a summary of what has been completed:

**Technical Improvements:**
- Fixed duplicate CSS issues that were affecting page loading speed
- Resolved Google Fonts configuration problems for better performance
- Implemented a proper mobile menu overlay that makes navigation much easier on phones and tablets

**User Experience Enhancements:**
- Improved accessibility features, including better skip-link functionality for keyboard navigation
- Created a dedicated newsletter archive page, making it easier for members to find past issues
- Successfully implemented dark mode functionality (though the toggle button was removed as requested)

**Benefits of These Changes:**
- The website now loads faster and performs better across all devices
- Mobile users will have a much smoother experience navigating the site
- The site is more accessible to users with disabilities
- Members can now easily browse through historical newsletters in one convenient location

All of these updates are now live on the website. The improvements should provide a better experience for all SAPA members and visitors.

If you'd like any additional adjustments or have any questions about the changes, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm happy to make any further modifications you might need.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on these improvements.

Thank you,
Arlen
